# Box-based advertisement dApp built-on Ethereum test network, Ropsten.

Inspired by [the Million Dollar Homepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage) this project provides a decentralized box-based advertisement where the boxes can be exchanged within users. Users can buy an empty box, set a price for the box they own for someone else to buy it, and buy boxes from other people by paying the price they demanded in ethers.

To test the web-app use a wallet and add the Ropsten test network, then
```sh
npm i
npm start
```
